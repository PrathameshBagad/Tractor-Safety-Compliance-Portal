# 🚜 Tractor Safety Compliance Portal

The **Tractor Safety Compliance Portal** is an AI-powered web application built to assist the RTO in monitoring agricultural vehicle safety. It automates video analysis to detect red cloth reflectors or number plates on tractors, flagging violations and extracting evidence frames to ensure compliance with road safety regulations.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### ✅ Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tractor-Safety-Compliance-Portal.git
cd Tractor-Safety-Compliance-Portal
```

### ✅ Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment:
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### ✅ Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install requirements for both apps:
```bash
pip install -r combined_tractor/requirements.txt
pip install -r tractor_frame_app/requirements.txt
```

### ✅ Step 4: Run the Apps

🔹 **To launch the Compliance Detection Portal:**
```bash
cd combined_tractor
streamlit run app.py
```

🔹 **To launch the Tractor Frame Extractor:**
```bash
cd tractor_frame_app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📋 Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Automatically detects red cloth reflectors and number plates on tractors
- **Video Analysis**: Processes video files to identify safety compliance violations
- **Frame Extraction**: Extracts evidence frames for violation documentation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Streamlined interface for RTO officials
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates detailed reports for safety violations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8 for object detection
- **OCR**: Tesseract for number plate recognition
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for web interface
- **Backend**: Python with OpenCV
- **Machine Learning**: Custom CNN models for classification
